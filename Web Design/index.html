<h2>PROFILE</h2>
	
<p>My name is Sadie Hopkins, I'm a senior at UNM and I major in Film History and Criticism. I am also a writer, an artist and a photographer, even if not by profession. They're hobbies I hope to make a career out of eventually, fate depending on whether the writer strike makes some sort of significant impact. I'm not comfortably skilled with technology; at least technology a little more advanced than writing, and breaking the computer's rules against downloading strange Flash clones. I have yet to find one that works, but, I have a little bit of experience manipulating files and programs. This is my first time trying out coding, and it gives me a special appreciation for people who are good at it, namely my super-genius brother.</p>

<h2>PORTFOLIO</h2>

</h1></body></html>
<p>I have a large portfolio, and I would like to put it together all in one spot, so it's easily accessible and I no longer have to rely on website builders to categorize my work. I've sold artwork on Etsy, but it's easy to fall through the cracks or get completely shunned by Etsy support (like I was, and this is why I no longer sell on Etsy.) I want to build up the skills to get me in a position to create my own space. This way, I can organize everything I want to sell and everything I don't similarly, and there'd be no more middle-man to suck half my money away.</p>
